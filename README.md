## My repository of PS scripts

## Description
This is a repository of different scripts and snippets of useful PowerShell things I've built or shamelessly stolen.
Credit where I can remember it. I may have things I stole that I don't remember where I got them from. 
I am a sysadmin and kept this stuff around for use, but practicality prevailed over strict documentation/sourcing.
Some of this stuff is super common, no apologies here. I am using this mostly as a personal resource.
