### Description
This is a repository of different scripts and snippets of useful PowerShell things I've built or shamelessly stolen.
Credit where I can remember it. I may have things I stole that I don't remember where I got them from. 
I am a sysadmin and kept this stuff around for use, but practicality prevailed over strict documentation/sourcing.
Some of this stuff is super common, no apologies here. I am using this mostly as a personal resource.

### List of scripts
**rdg-to-serverlist.ps1**
Parses a .rdg file for server names and dumps to a .txt file. Rough but useful.

**server-cert.ps1**
Takes a txt file list of servers and outputs a list of server certificates. Needs work.
